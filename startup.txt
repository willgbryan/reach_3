.env.local in /frontend and /backend. Hard code supabase_url and key into pptx.utils.py. and root level .env

2 dockerfiles, dont need to touch the backend one, frontend has a dev prod split. retain top set of commands and comment out bottom set.

root level docker compose handles the full build and also has a dev prod split. comment out bottom one for dev.

build commands:
    docker compose build
    docker compose up -d

    to tear down

    docker compose down
    docker system prune (and then y)

    note

    check volumes in docker desktop and clear every so often

for debugging there are 2 places to look.

    1. container logs (frontend and backend container)
    2. 'inspect element' console logs (you'll see api errors here)

in /frontend/src/utils/websocket.ts comment out prod uri and comment in devuri

package installation

    /backend - add to requirements.txt
    /frontend - cd into frontend and run npm install <package> --legacy-peer-deps

another note

    frontend changes are tailed
    backend changes are not tailed, so any change to the backend will require a rebuild
